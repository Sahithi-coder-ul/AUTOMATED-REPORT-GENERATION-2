##DESCRIPTION:

 I was assigned the challenge of creating an automated report generation system. The objective was to develop a Python script that could read data from a file, analyze it, and then generate a well-formatted PDF report using libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab.

This task allowed me to enhance my skills in data processing and report automation. I chose to work with the ReportLab library due to its flexibility in designing structured PDF documents. I started by writing a script to read and analyze data from a CSV file. After performing some basic data analysis, I created a professional-looking PDF that included tables, headings, and summaries.

This experience not only strengthened my Python programming abilities but also gave me practical exposure to generating business-ready reports automatically. It was a valuable learning experience in terms of scripting, PDF handling, and understanding real-world applications of automation.
